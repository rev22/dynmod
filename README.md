dynmod
======

This is my work for a module system intended to be used as a basis for a dynamic programming language.

To use this library, you currently need my Reflection-enabled CoffeeScript fork, found here:
https://github.com/rev22/reflective-coffeescript

'loader.coffee' can be used to bootstrap the module system.
